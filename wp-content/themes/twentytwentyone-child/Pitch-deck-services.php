                               <p>With many businesses eager to pursue growth, explore new markets and increase exports, the ability to navigate the complex funding landscape is essential in making these ambitions a reality. With a growing market of alternative finance options offering a vast array of capital sources alongside traditional bank lending, it can be increasingly difficult to grasp which funding is right for a particular business and understand the financial jargon that comes with it.</p>

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>

There is no obligation to make regular repayments like debt funding, however a percentage of the business will belong to another party and the level of business control and decision making an owner has may be affected.</p>

                   <h2>Advantages of Debt Funding</h2>
                   <h5>Owners keep business control</h5>
                   <p>A major advantage of securing debt funding is that you do not need to give up stakes in the business in order to receive capital. Unlike equity finance, decision making and business control remains undiluted, giving the comfort that the current management team is still 100% in control.</p>
                   <h5>Flexible repayment plans</h5>
                   <p>With repayments and interest set out in advance, a business can monitor cashflows and plan for future growth. You will know how much is needed to be paid back each month thereby supporting better budgeting and planning.</p>
                   <h5>Flexible opportunities</h5>
                   <p>Long-term debt can be used for a multitude of business purposes from MBOs, to shareholder transaction, from property developments to growth capital. Every business strategy is different and finding the right type of funding and right partner is essential to fulfilling business growth plans.</p>

                   <h2>How it works?</h2>
                   <p>Debt in essence is an exchange between a business (borrower) and a lending partner. The lender will release a capital sum to a business under the condition a business meets certain criteria and terms are agreed.</p>
                   <p>Terms will include a repayment schedule, whether that means paying the whole amount back in full at a later date (bullet repayments) or through multiple smaller amounts over a set period. They will also include the amount of interest that is expected to be repaid on top of the capital borrowed, and any penalties for late repayments.</p>

                                   Debt funding allows businesses to access immediate capital without diluting ownership. It offers flexibility in terms of repayment options, interest rates, and loan durations. Debt funding also helps build a credit history and relationships with lenders.

                                     There are a number of different types of debt funding available in India, including:
                                       <br>
                                    <br> <strong> Bank loans: </strong> Banks are the most common source of debt funding in India. Bank loans can be secured or unsecured, and they can have fixed or variable interest rates.
                             
                                    <br> <strong> Non-bank financial companies (NBFCs):</strong> NBFCs are another important source of debt funding in India. NBFCs offer a wider range of products than banks, including term loans, working capital loans, and equipment financing.

                                   <br> <strong> Private credit:</strong> Private credit is a type of debt funding that is provided by private investors, such as family offices and high-net-worth individuals. Private credit typically offers higher interest rates than bank loans or NBFC loans, but it can be a good option for businesses that need quick access to capital.

                                    <br><strong>  Alternative investment funds (AIFs): </strong>AIFs are a type of investment fund that is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). AIFs can invest in a variety of assets, including debt, equity, and real estate. AIFs can be a good option for businesses that need to raise large amounts of capital.

                                  Secured debt is debt that is backed by collateral, such as real estate or equipment. Unsecured debt is debt that is not backed by collateral. Secured debt is typically less expensive than unsecured debt, because lenders have a lower risk of losing money if the borrower defaults on the loan.

                                   Project finance is a type of debt financing that is used to finance specific projects, such as construction projects or infrastructure projects. Project finance typically involves a number of different lenders, each of which provides a portion of the financing.

                                  The interest rate for debt funding is typically based on several factors, including the borrower’s creditworthiness, prevailing market rates, the type and duration of the loan, and the collateral provided (if applicable). Lenders assess these factors to determine the level of risk associated with the loan and set an interest rate accordingly.

                                   Debt funding has an impact on a company’s financial statements. It increases liabilities, which can be seen in the balance sheet as long-term or short-term debt. Additionally, the interest paid on the debt is reflected in the income statement as an expense, reducing the company’s net income. It is essential for businesses to carefully manage their debt levels and ensure that debt funding aligns with their financial goals.
